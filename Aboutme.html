    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>
      I am currently pursuing a degree in engineering, where I am honing my
      skills and expanding my knowledge in this dynamic field. My passion for
      technology extends beyond my studies; I am deeply interested in game
      development and coding, which I actively explore through personal projects
      and coursework.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Outside of my academic and professional pursuits, I have a keen interest
      in video games and cars, which inspire both my creativity and technical
      curiosity. Additionally, I have a dedicated hobby in coin collection,
      which reflects my appreciation for history and attention to detail.
    </p>

    <p>
      As I continue my journey, I am excited to combine my engineering
      background with my enthusiasm for game development, aiming to contribute
      to innovative and engaging experiences in the gaming industry.
